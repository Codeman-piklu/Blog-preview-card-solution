## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Custom hover and focus states
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - Figtree font

### What I learned

This challenge improved my skills in creating responsive and accessible designs with hover effects. Here are some specific highlights:

- Using CSS variables for a consistent color palette:
- css
  :root {
    --Yellow: hsl(47, 88%, 63%);
    --White: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    --Gray500: hsl(0, 0%, 42%);
    --Gray950: hsl(0, 0%, 7%);
  }
.container:hover {
  box-shadow: 15px 10px 8px rgb(228, 155, 110);
}

a[title~='Learning']:hover {
  background-color: rgba(212, 209, 23, 0.445);
  box-shadow: 2px 1px 1px rgb(173, 152, 152);
}


### Continued development
In future projects, I plan to:

    Explore CSS Grid for layout design.
    Experiment with advanced animations to enhance interactivity.
    Improve accessibility using ARIA roles and landmarks.
